This repository includes the scripts and data that was used for generating the "Svalbard Custom Scenery". data/SRTM-3, data/shapefiles and the work*/ folders are not included for file size reasons, but they can be generated using the scripts given here.  

### Following sources have been used:

* SRTM-3 global elevation data from http://viewfinderpanoramas.org/Coverage%20map%20viewfinderpanoramas_org3.htm
* Landcover Data from https://www.openstreetmap.org/export, https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html and
	https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/s100-map-data/bd6050e8-7182-459b-9989-66c4ecbae874 (c) Kartverket, see LICENSE_NorwayPolarInstitute.txt
* Airport Data from https://gateway.x-plane.com, partly modified
* Objects from FlightGear's terrasync and created/placed myself

Thanks to _laserman_ for scripts to process airport data files into groundnets (https://github.com/mherweg/d-laser-fgtools)!
